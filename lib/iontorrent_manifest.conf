# A manifest file can contain comment lines, these start with the #-character
# First part of a manifest: defining some basic things
# In this example, we just give a name to the assembly
# and tell MIRA it should assemble a genome de-novo in accurate mode
# As special parameter, we want to use 4 threads in parallel (where possible)
job = genome,denovo,accurate
parameters = COMMON_SETTINGS -NW:cac=no -NW:cmrnl=no -OUT:ora=yes:rtd=no IONTOR_SETTINGS -AS:mrpc=100
# The second part defines the sequencing data MIRA should load and assemble
# The data is logically divided into "readgroups", for more information
# please consult the MIRA manual, chapter "Reference"
readgroup = DataIontorLib
data = input/input.fastq
technology = iontor
# note the wildcard "dh10b*" part in the ’data’ line above:
# if you followed the walkthrough and have the FASTQ and XML file,
# this will automatically load both files (which is what we want)
