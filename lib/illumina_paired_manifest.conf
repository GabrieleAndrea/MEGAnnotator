# A manifest file can contain comment lines, these start with the #-character
# First part of a manifest: defining some basic things
# In this example, we just give a name to the assembly
# and tell MIRA it should assemble a genome de-novo in accurate mode
# As special parameter, we want to use 4 threads in parallel (where possible)
